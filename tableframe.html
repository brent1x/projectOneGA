     While flying in Salt Lake City Class B airspace today, the approach controller gave us a trafficwarning of "unkown type and altitude" that popped up on radar about 1 mile in front of us. I spotted what I at first thought was big, birthday-party sized Mylar balloon. As we got a bit closer, it turned out to be a large-ish UAV with a flashing green light one side. I didn't get close enough to spot what model, brand, how many rotors, etc., but it was large enough to carry an SLR at least and did have something hanging on it. The camera was busy shooting down through the vertical port, so I didn't get a photo, and I didn't really want to circle back to take a closer look. We were 1,200ft AGL, and it was maybe 100ft above us, 6 miles South of Salt Lake International Airport, and well inside the surface area of the Class B airspace.  </td></tr>

     While driving through Griffin, Georgia on 05-01-2014 at 1730 hours approx 1 mile east of 6A2 on HillStreet in between the intersections of Soloman Street and Taylor Street, I observed an "octo-copter" type UAS vehicle carrying a camera and operating directly over heavy traffic below the height of the adjacent buildings lining the street. I also observed several individuals at the intersection of Hill Street and Soloman Street conducting filming operations on the ground as well. On 05-02-2014, I spoke with representatives from ASO-220 and FSDO-11 in regards to any knowledge of this filming operations, in particular the UAS operation. Both offices had no knowledge of such operation. I then began to investigate as to whom may be filming in Griffin at this time. I researched the Griffin Daily News website and located an article in regards to a company by the name of Stalwart Films being in the area filming the same week. I also researched the internet for a contact number for Stalwart Films. Once I found a local contact number for Stalwart Films, I proceeded to contact them in regards to the UAS operation on 05-01-2014. I was given a name of [redacted] in production to speak to. I contacted [redacted] and began to inquire to the UAS operation. [redacted] denied that Stalwart Films was operating a UAS type vehicle or "drone" as he mentioned for filming purposes but did confirm they were filming in the same location as I observed the UAS operation. I drove the same route on 05-03-2014 but did not observe any filming type operations. On 05-05-2014 I overheard a report of a similar type UAS operated on or about 05-03-2014 in the McDonough, Georgia area in what appears to be the approach area for KATL. It was reported that this aircraft may have been operating at an altitude of about 4000 ft. I find it interesting that a similar type UAS aircraft operating in 2 areas relatively close in proximity in a time span of only a couple of days. There is a concern as to the safety of the operation of this type of UAS platform for the use of filming in what the FAA considers a populated or urban area and lacking an evaluation by the FAA in regards to the necessity of a Certificate of Authorization as per Notice 8900.227, effective 07-30-2013. </td></tr>

    The Cook County Police informed Regional Counsel that they were investigating a crashed unmannedaircraft (UA) found on the property of Tech-cor, in Wheeling, IL. The street address is 100 E. Palatine Rd., Wheeling IL. This is approximately 1/4nm from Chicago Executive Airport (PWK). The UA was found by a Tech-cor guard on the business property during morning rounds on Sunday 4/6/14. The aircraft appears to be a Lumenier QAV540G quadcopter, with a first-person-view camera attached. It had two broken propellers, but otherwise no apparent damage. There was no additional camera for taking and/or storing imagery. There is no other evidence to the cause of the crash. There is no evidence as to what the purpose or mission of the UA was. This record is being closed with no further action required </td></tr>

     On 08Apr14, a store customer observed a UA fall from the sky at an HEB food store in Cypress, TX.The customer found the UAV lying on the ground with a small camera attached. According to the SOI, no one has been able to determine who the UA belongs to.While Cypress, TX does not contain any MTSA-regulated facilities, this city is located within the Sector Houston-Galveston AOR. This report is the fourth such report on UAs in the past month for the AOR. The same day of the UA discovery, there was a major traffic fatality accident nearby on State Highway 290. It is possible that the UA could have been used to obtain aerial photographs of the accident scene, which was a major media event in the Houston area. </td></tr>
