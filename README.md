## ABOUT

This is my first coding project. I joined General Assembly SF's web development program 4 weeks ago with (almost) zero knowledge in programming. I started this project to meet the requirements of our first week-long assignment in the course, which are to demonstrate knowledge of JS/jQuery, HTML and CSS. I know a lot of the code is inelegant and inefficient, so I'd love your help if you'd like to contribute!

The inspiration for this project arose from my observations surrounding drone usage in the US:

- Consumer demand for drones is growing at an explosive pace, as evidenced by companies like GoPro flooding into the market and price points becoming more attainable for mainstream users
– Commercial applications are becoming more widespread (i.e. Amazon & Alibaba delivery services, aerial surveying, professional-grade photography, Tacocopter!!!)
- As a correlate to the growth of drones, incidents involving drones are increasing
- As mainstream usage of drones increases, illicit and/or nefarious use cases will not trail far behind
- The media's coverage of drone-related incidents is becoming increasingly more strident
- Legislation from the US Government and formal regulations from the FAA are several years behind these interrelated trends

I have no stance on whether drones are 'good' or not. This project (currently) serves only to visually represent the number of incidents reported in the United States, where the data is most readily available.

## EVOLUTION

As mentioned above, I would love help evolving this project, so please fork and go! Or you can get in touch with me (@brent1x on Twitter) if you have suggestions for improvements.

I would also love to create an API and surface this data to other developers so they can build their own apps. It would be cool if this project became the canonical source of all consumer drone incidents worldwide. If anyone is interested in moderating and collating incident submissions, I would love to have your help as well since the utility of this project will determined by the richness of its dataset.
