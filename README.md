** ABOUT

This is my first ever coding project. 

I joined General Assembly's web development program 3 weeks ago with zero knowledge of programming. I started this project to meet the requirements of our first week-long assignment in the course, which are to demonstrate knowledge of JS/jQuery, HTML and CSS. I know a lot of the code is messy and inelegant, so I've put it under the MIT license in case anyone wants to contribute.

The inspiration for the project arose from observations surrounding the consumer drone trend:

- Consumer demand for drones is growing at an explosive pace, as evidenced by companies like GoPro flooding into the market and price points becoming more attainable for people who want a 'cool new toy'
- As a correlate to the growth in users, incidents involving drones are increasing. It seems like it's only a matter of time before one is used for intentionally nefarious purposes
- The media's coverage of these incidents are becoming more strident, mostly thanks to...
- Legislation from the US Government and formal regulations from the FAA trailing several years behind the rise of consumer drones

I have no stance on whether drones are 'good' or not. This project serves only to visually demonstrate the number of incidents reported in the United States.

** TECHNOLOGIES AND LIBRARIES USED

HTML5
CSS3
Vanilla JS
jQuery
Pure CSS
Normalize CSS
Chart.JS
Google Maps V3 API
Fullpage.JS
Slimscroll.JS

** EVOLUTION

As I mentioned above, this is covered by the MIT license, so please fork this project on Github and go nuts.

I would love help evolving this project to become database-driven, especially for the Chart.JS module, the raw data table and the Google Maps visualization. Currently I'm manually updating each module.

I would also love to create an API and surface the data to other developers so they can build their own apps. It would be cool if this project became the canonical source of all consumer drone incidents.

Finally, if anyone wants to help moderate and collate incident submissions, I would love to have your help. Send me an email at brentdady@gmail.com or find me on Twitter at @brent1x.
