        "Narrative": "While driving through Griffin, Georgia on 05-01-2014 at 1730 hours approx 1  mile east of 6A2 on Hill Street in between the intersections of Soloman  Street and Taylor Street, I observed an \"octo-copter\" type UAS vehicle  carrying a camera and operating directly over heavy traffic below the height  of the adjacent buildings lining the street. I also observed several  individuals at the intersection of Hill Street and Soloman Street conducting  filming operations on the ground as well. On 05-02-2014, I spoke with representatives from ASO-220 and FSDO-11 in regards to any knowledge of this filming operations, in particular the UAS operation. Both offices had no knowledge of such operation. I then began to investigate as to whom may be filming in Griffin at this time. I researched the Griffin Daily News website and located an article in regards to a company by the name of Stalwart Films being in the area filming the same week. I also researched the internet for a contact number for Stalwart Films. Once I found a local contact number for Stalwart Films, I proceeded to contact them in regards to the UAS operation on 05-01-2014. I was given a name of [redacted] in production to speak to. I contacted [redacted] and began to inquire to the UAS operation. [redacted] denied that Stalwart Films was operating a UAS type vehicle or \"drone\" as he mentioned for filming purposes but did confirm they were filming in the same location as I observed the UAS operation. I drove the same route on 05-03-2014 but did not observe any filming type operations. On 05-05-2014 I overheard a report of a similar type UAS operated on or about 05-03-2014 in the McDonough, Georgia area in what appears to be the approach area for KATL. It was reported that this aircraft may have been operating at an altitude of about 4000 ft. I find it interesting that a similar type UAS aircraft operating in 2 areas relatively close in proximity in a time span of only a couple of days. There is a concern as to the safety of the operation of this type of UAS platform for the use of filming in what the FAA considers a populated or urban area and lacking an evaluation by the FAA in regards to the necessity of a Certificate of Authorization as per Notice 8900.227, effective 07-30-2013."

It is possible that the UA could have been used to obtain aerial photographs of the accident scene, which was a major media event in the Houston area."
